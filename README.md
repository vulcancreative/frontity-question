# cmc-frontend

Welcome to the CMC front-end repository. This repository holds the scripts, files, and support materials for the client-facing side of your website. Your site has been written in TypeScript and SCSS, using Vulcan's custom framework.

Until the official launch of your website (after testing, a soft-launch, and other final steps polishing the product), all work contained in the repository is a work-in-progress. You will be able to see your Figma designs come into production throughout the development process. If at any time you have questions, please feel welcome to reach out to your account manager [Chris](mailto:ccalo@vulcanca.com) at any point.
